<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was based on the [Wio Terminal Timer](https://www.hackster.io/SeeedStudio/wio-terminal-timer-6afe8c/) and was developed to see if I could get the LovyaGFX library working with the M5Core2 library. It also demonstrates how use a sound file with the Core2 without an external library.
