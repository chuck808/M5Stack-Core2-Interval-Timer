# M5Stack-Core2-Interval-Timer
Countdown Interval Timer using M5Stack Core2 &amp; LovyanGFX - aka. HIIT, Gym, Pomodoro, CrossFit Timer


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was based on the [Wio Terminal Timer](https://www.hackster.io/SeeedStudio/wio-terminal-timer-6afe8c/) and was developed to see if I could get the LovyaGFX library working with the M5Core2 library. It also demonstrates how use a sound file with the Core2 without an external library.
